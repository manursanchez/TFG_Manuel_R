El subconjunto de datos ha de cumplir ciertas características que el usuario o programador indicará antes del procesamiento Map. En este tipo de patrones solo se ejecuta el map. La idea es que un Map proporcione información filtrada a otro Map, para que este a su vez haga una operacion de resumen usando Reduce.\n",

Around 1992 (when Pentium came out), disks maxed out at about 1MB/sec.  FDIV results in a 10-byte result.  Assume on the 486 and Pentium system we use pseudo-random numbers from the same seed, so all we need are the results.  At 1MB/sec, we can write to the local disk at 100,000 results/second.  FDIV on Pentium took 39 clocks, and Pentium released at 60MHz.  So we're limited by disk speed to write the results.  At 100,000 results per second, that leave 600-39=561 clocks to do FP emulation of FDIV.  This is trivial, emulation can be done at least twice that fast without even being carefully optimized.  That beats just writing the results to disk, and ignores the time to read back the results for comparison.

The additional point is that in many cases there are multiple paths between two nodes that have the same minimum weight.  In this case, the length you need to use is the shortest length of the equal minimum weight paths.  (For some people, this just falls out in the way they wrote their algorithms.

Around 1992 (when Pentium came out), disks maxed out at about 1MB/sec.  FDIV results in a 10-byte result.  Assume on the 486 and Pentium system we use pseudo-random numbers from the same seed, so all we need are the results.  At 1MB/sec, we can write to the local disk at 100,000 results/second.  FDIV on Pentium took 39 clocks, and Pentium released at 60MHz.  So we're limited by disk speed to write the results.  At 100,000 results per second, that leave 600-39=561 clocks to do FP emulation of FDIV.  This is trivial, emulation can be done at least twice that fast without even being carefully optimized.  That beats just writing the results to disk, and ignores the time to read back the results for comparison.  Even if you assume much faster disks, once you count in the time to read back the results, FP emulation easily is the better choice.</p>\", \"comment\", \"12003233\", \"12003201\", \"2012-07-30 19:02:33.866452+00\", \"2\", \"\", \"\\\\N\", \"100031056\", \"2012-07-30 19:02:33.866452+00\", \"12004472\", \"\\\\N\", \"\\\\N\", \"0\", \"f\"]\n",

I was under impression that the first problem is usually called \\\"\\\"k-coloring problem\\\"\\\" and the second \\\"\\\"chromatic number problem\\\"\\\". The first is obviously in NP but it is not so clear about the second one. At the same time I remember that \\\"\\\"chromatic number problem\\\"\\\" was one of the original NP-complete problems presented by Karp in his <a href=\\\"\\\"http://www.cs.berkeley.edu/~luca/cs172/karp.pdf\\\"\\\" rel=\\\"\\\"nofollow\\\"\\\">seminal paper published in 70s</a> (look at page 95). It is also listed as such in Wikipedia's <a href=\\\"\\\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karp%E2%80%99s_21_NP-complete_problems\\\"\\\" rel=\\\"\\\"nofollow\\\"\\\">list of NP-complete problems</a>. I had this at the back of my mind from prior studies. What I did not realize though that apparently there is a terminological disagreement about what to call a \\\"\\\"chromatic number problem\\\"\\\". As it is obvious from carefully reading Karp's paper what he calls a \\\"\\\"chromatic number problem\\\"\\\" is generally known as a \\\"\\\"k-coloring problem\\\"\\\", i.e. problem of verifying that graph can be colored with k colors. On the other hand, WolframAlfa article states (unambiguously this time) that chromatic number problem is NP-complete and references Skiena's text:  </p>\"]\r\n",

To proof the later you need to show that there is no easy certificate/verifier for a chromatic number problem. Showing that problem is in co-NP also does not prove it is not in NP (as there exist problems which are both in NP and co-NP)</p>\\\"\", \"comment\", \"11004312\", \"11004305\", \"2012-08-02 17:36:20.921254+00\", \"0\", \"\", \"11036206\", \"100073491\", \"2012-08-02 17:37:25.083191+00\", \"11006414\", \"\\\\N\", \"\\\\N\", \"0\", \"f\"]\r\n",

The additional point is that in many cases there are multiple paths between two nodes that have the same minimum weight.  In this case, the length you need to use is the shortest length of the equal minimum weight paths.  (For some people, this just falls out in the way they wrote their algorithms.
